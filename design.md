# Solar Panel Theme
## Smart Solar Tracker

> There are various smart devices that I would want to be able to work on by myself. However, to get a start with making smart appliances, I have picked “Solar Tracker” as my first project to work on. In theory, the solar tracker, as the meaning of its name, will track the movement of the Sun by detecting the surroundings' ambient temperature concentration. Therefore, it could observe more sunlight power and transfer it into electrical energy for personal use. The stimulation will be using an Arduino Uno, a Servo Motor, a Crash Sensor, a Solar Panel, 2x LDRs and 2x 10k Ohm 0.5 Watt Resistors. The other sensors will activate as outputs such as LEDs, buzzers, etc. In order to improve the system more, I would make the code more complicated as it would need to be able to use the energy that is transferred from the Solar panel into the in-use house’s lighting system.
# Behaviour
## Function
- When the Solar Tracker detects the Sun, the buzzer will play a confirmed sound.

- When the Servo Motor is activated, rotate the Solar Panel so that it can observe the Sun in multi-direction.

- When LDR is activated, detect the highest possible light levels (the more LDRs used, the more accurate it is).

- Using a Crash sensor as a button, and an LED display as a log display, when it is pressed, start observing the lights from the Sun and show the total transferred light energy onto the LED display.
